##PCA
 In Machine Learning PCA is an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction technique for high dimensional data.
 It uses simple matrix operations from linear algebra and statistics to figure out how to project the original data into same number or less number of features.
 
 Because it is hard to learn from  high dimension data and it take lots of compututation power.
